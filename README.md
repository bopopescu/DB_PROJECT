# DB_PROJECT
This is a Database project that is intended to teach us the basics of creating a Database and interacting with it via 
JDBC(If I were using JAVA)..But, Since I decided to write the program in Python, I used mysql-connector.

Forgive any coding mistakes...or format errors, I am still a noob when it comes to coding...I welcome constructive critism!
